[I] A minimalist window manager for the X Window System. 

[T] evilwm - we sold our souls to the window manager
[T] evilwm is a minimalistic window manager that features good keyboard control
[T] and few window decoration. 'Minimalist' here doesn't mean it's too bare to
[T] be usable - it just means it omits a lot of the stuff that make other
[T] window managers unusable.
