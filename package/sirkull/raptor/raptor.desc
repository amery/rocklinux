[I] An RDF parser library in C.

[T] Raptor is a C library for parsing RDF syntaxes into RDF triples. It 
[T] supports the latest revision of RDF/XML (including collections and 
[T] datatypes), N-Triples, and some XML RSS via a tag soup parser. It 
[T] handles the RDF/XML used by RDF applications such as RSS 1.0, FOAF, 
[T] Dublin Core, and OWL. It can use either expat or libxml2 for XML 
[T] parsing, libcurl when available for URI retrieval, and is portable to 
[T] many POSIX systems.
