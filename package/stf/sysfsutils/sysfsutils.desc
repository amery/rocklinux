[I] utilities for the Linux kernel sysfs filesystem

[T] This package's purpose is to provide a set of utilities for interfacing
[T] with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 2.5+ that provides
[T] a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a very useful interface,
[T] we've decided to provide a stable programming interface that will hopefully
[T] make it easier for applications to query system devices and their attributes.
[T] This package currently includes:
[T] - libsysfs: a library for accessing system devices.
[T] - systool: an application to view system device information by bus, class,
[T]    and topology.
[T] - A number of example usage routines in the "test" directory.
[T] - A comprehensive testsuite, also shipped as part of the "test" directory. 
[T]    This testsuite can be used to test _all_ the APIs exported by Libsysfs.
[T]    Please refer the libsysfs.txt file in the "docs" directory for details
[T]    as to how to use the testsuite.
