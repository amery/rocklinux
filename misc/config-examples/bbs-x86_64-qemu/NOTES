Introduction
------------

This configuration offers a cross-build of (a subset of) the build-bootstrap
package selection for the x86_64 architecture as emulated by qemu-system-x86_64.
It includes support for all the hardware emulated by qemu, a working udev,
kernel and userland support for TCP/IP networking, and more.

With qemu and the resulting build you can at least:
- boot the kernel and first stage initrd,
- execute a shell from the initrd,
- load the second stage from a CD-ROM,
- and install packages from the CD on a hard disk.

The packages included should be sufficient for native builds on the targeted
platform.

Quick Start
-----------

- Boot from CD with VGA text console:
    qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom bbs-x86_64-qemu_cd1.iso -hda /srv/qemu.hda \
	-boot d

Hints And Known Bugs
--------------------

- To use the cdrom image in qemu, create it after the build has finished:
    ./scripts/Create-ISO bbs-x86_64-qemu bbs-x86_64-qemu

- To use a hard disk in qemu, create it with e.g.:
    qemu-img create /srv/qemu.hda 2048M

- Package installation with stone does not work yet; use mine directly to
  install packages.
